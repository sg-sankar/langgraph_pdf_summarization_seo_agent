# 🧠 LangGraph PDF Summarization SEO Agent

An AI-powered content pipeline that extracts, summarizes, and converts any URL into a branded, SEO-friendly PDF — powered by **LangGraph** for flow orchestration and **LangChain** for summarization.

## 🚀 What It Does

This notebook builds a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) LangGraph agent that:
- Accepts a URL as input
- Extracts the article using `trafilatura`
- Summarizes the content with LangChain (OpenAI/GPT)
- Ensures SEO-ready format (max 5 clean sentences)
- Generates a PDF with branding via `reportlab`
- Returns both the summary and downloadable PDF path
